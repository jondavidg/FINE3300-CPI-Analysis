# CPI-Analysis
FINE3300 - Assignment 2 Submission - Jonathan Gieb
The associated python script ingests, transforms, and combines 11 datasets containing monthly CPI data: one dataset for Canada and one dataset for each of the 10 provinces. Once the combined data frame has been created, the first 12 rows of the dataset are printed to validate alignment with the desired format. The script then runs several computations on the combined dataset to derive insights. First, for the item categories of food, shelter, and All-items excluding food and energy, month-to-month percentage change values are computed by jurisdiction and item category. Using these values, average month-to-month percentage change values are then computed by jurisdiction and item category. Second, for each of these categories, the script determines and returns the province with the highest absolute average change. Third, for each jurisdiction, the script computes the annual percentage change in CPI for services in particular. Lastly, the script determines and returns the jurisdiction with the highest inflation value.
